      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">FIELD</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The present disclosure relates generally to LED light fixtures for use in deep water environments. More specifically, but not exclusively, this disclosure relates to LED light fixtures configured with a substantially or partially spherical housing to provide enhanced heat dissipation.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Semiconductor LEDs have largely replaced conventional incandescent, fluorescent and halogen lighting sources in many applications due to their long life, ruggedness, color rendering, efficacy, and compatibility with other solid state devices. In marine applications, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are emerging as a desired light source for their energy efficiency, instant on-off characteristics, color purity, and vibration resistance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">LEDs are an efficient light source widely available, having surpassed High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps in lumens per watt. Different uses of LEDs in various light applications, including use of LEDs in marine environments, offer unique advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">For example, LEDs designed to deliver high levels of brightness suffer from problems associated with heat dissipation and inefficient distribution of light for certain applications. While these high brightness LEDs are significantly more efficient than incandescent systems or gas-filled (halogen or fluorescent) systems, they still dissipate on the order of 50% of their energy in heat. If this heat is not managed, it can induce thermal-runaway conditions within the LED, resulting in their failure. For situations requiring high levels of lighting, this situation is aggravated by combining many high brightness LEDs in a tight geometrical pattern within a light-source structure. Heat management becomes a primary constraint for applications seeking to use the other advantages of high brightness LEDs as a source of illumination.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">For example, underwater lighting devices that use LEDs may require configurations that compensate for ambient pressure and/or rising internal temperature in order to avoid catastrophic failure of all or a portion of the lighting device. Such configurations may use a pressure-protected housing to isolate the LEDs from the ambient pressure, or may immerse the LEDs in a fluid-filled temperature compensation environment to provide thermal management.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">However, the disadvantages of fluid-filling an LED light may include decreased light beam control and increased contamination of the LED phosphor coating. Thus, protecting LEDs from the external pressure and excess internal temperature using a pressure-protected and thermally-efficient housing is desired.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Accordingly, there is a need in the art to address the above-described and other problems.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">The present disclosure relates generally to LED light fixtures configured with a substantially or partially spherical housing to provide enhanced heat dissipation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In one aspect, this disclosure relates to a LED light fixture. The LED light fixture may be configured to provide enhanced or improved heat dissipation during operation in deep water environments.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">The LED light fixture may include, for example, a housing, which may be made of metal and may include a front and a rear section. The housing may have a hollow interior and an aperture extending through a front side of the housing. A transparent window may extend across the aperture. An LED may be disposed in the housing.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0006\" level=\"1\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0007\" level=\"1\">Overview</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">The present disclosure relates generally to LED spherical light fixtures. In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to embodiments of an LED spherical light fixture with reduced weight and enhanced heat dissipation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">The LED light fixtures of the present disclosure may be configured for deep submersible applications that require a lightweight assembly and can withstand high pressure environment at significant ocean depths, e.g. 1400 meters and deeper. The LED light fixtures of the present disclosure may conduct the heat generated from an LED driver circuit laterally through a printed circuit board (PCB), a metal outer housing, and then out into the cold surrounding ocean.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">Those of skill in the art will appreciate that various thermally-conductive materials may be used for some or all components described herein. Examples of thermally conductive materials include pure metals, metal alloys, plastics, ceramics, and other materials. Materials may also be selected to withstand pressures exerted on the materials by an external environment (e.g., a deep, marine environment), varying temperatures of the external environment, and other conditions imposed on the materials by the external environments.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">The LED driver circuitry may or may not be a part of the PCB, as dictated by package design, economics, and heat management. The present disclosure may provide the shortest path from the heat sink of a high intensity LED and associated driver circuit, to the environment surrounding the light fixture, with a minimal number of thermal boundaries in between. This configuration may provide a means to efficiently radiate substantial heat away from the light fixture, and into the cool ocean surrounding the light fixture during operation. Thermal grooves may be formed on the exterior surface of the light fixture body or housing to increase the radiant surface area, thereby enhancing and/or improving heat dissipation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">The present disclosure provides LED light fixtures configured for use at significant ocean depths with reduced weight, by incorporating an efficient pressure-resistant interior volume and reduced wall thickness. With its intrinsic ability to balance external forces, a partially or substantially spherical housing may resist increasing ambient pressure encountered at deep sea depths. With reduced wall thickness, the weight of the light fixture housing may be minimized for a given water displacement, thus significantly reducing the submerged water weight of the LED light fixture. The improved LED light fixtures may provide deep sea vehicle designers the option of mounting the LED light fixtures where they are needed with less concern for weight-and-balance of the undersea vehicle. Less buoyancy is needed to float the undersea vehicle, meaning less weight over the side, smaller vehicle size, fewer trim weights, and less time to prep a dive. The reduced wall thickness of the LED light housing may also improve the thermal management of the LED lights. For example, heat may be transferred from the interior electronics to the cold surrounding environment (e.g., the ocean), increasing the light output potential of the system.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">In accordance with the present disclosure, an LED light fixture includes an LED PCB having a rear side and a front side. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the LED PCB in each embodiment may be a metal core PCB (MCPCB) or some other PCB. One or more LEDs may be mounted to the front side of the LED PCB. The LED PCB may be mounted approximately tangential within an aperture formed in a front side of the substantially spherical outer metallic housing. A window made of a transparent material with a high refractive index and thermal conductivity, such as sapphire, may extend across the aperture and may be sealed to the housing. The window may optionally be protected by a window retaining flange (e.g., a plastic flange). Excess heat from the LED PCB may be drawn off by the housing and/or window, and transferred to the surrounding ambient environment (e.g., ocean).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">The spherical housing may be constructed using two partially or substantially hemispherical halves that may be assembled using an interior or exterior threaded center coupling element. An LED driver PCB may be suspended by the threaded center coupling element. Excess heat emitted from the LED driver PCB may be drawn off by the threaded center coupling element and transferred to the spherical housing where it may be dissipated into the surrounding environment (e.g., ocean water).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">Mounting the LED PCB approximately tangential to the exterior surface of the forward pressure housing may reduce potential degradation of the pressure bearing ability of the substantially spherical shape of the outer housing, while providing ease of electrical connection to the LED driver PCB, and substantial heat sinking of the LED PCB. The use of an aperture with a stepped construction (as shown in several figures) provides several surfaces on the housing to which the LED PCB can transfer thermal energy.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">The LED PCB may be mounted at one pole of the forward pressure housing and an electrical interface connector may be mounted at an opposite pole of the aft pressure housing. An LED driver PCB may be attached at the interior equator of the housing&#x2014;i.e. the plane of maximum cross-section within the spherical outer housing&#x2014;thereby providing more room for required electronic components. This equatorial attachment may provide a mechanism for cooling by physically decoupling the LED driver PCB heat sinking from the LED PCB heat sinking.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">Various additional aspects, details, features, and functions are described below in conjunction with the appended figures.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The following exemplary embodiments are provided for the purpose of illustrating examples of various aspects, details, and functions of apparatus and systems; however, the described embodiments are not intended to be in any way limiting. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various aspects may be implemented in other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">It is noted that as used herein, the term, &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any aspect, detail, function, implementation, and/or embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects and/or embodiments.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0008\" level=\"1\">Example Embodiments</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of an underwater LED light fixture <b>100</b> in accordance with certain aspects is illustrated. Light fixture <b>100</b> may include a pressure housing, which may include one or more components or assemblies, such as a forward pressure housing (or body) <b>110</b> and an aft pressure housing (or body) <b>120</b>. Forward pressure housing <b>110</b> may include a light assembly, which may include one or more components, such as a window retaining flange <b>114</b>, which surrounds and protects a transparent panel, such as window <b>112</b>, which may be recessed below the level of the window retaining flange <b>114</b>. The window retaining flange <b>114</b> may be constructed of strong materials such as plastics or polymers, to provide high impact strength to deflect foreign object impacts and the like.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">In a typical embodiment, window <b>112</b>, which may extend across the aperture and may be sealed to the housing <b>110</b>, may be made of a suitably high strength transparent material, such as glass, acrylic, sapphire, or other suitable material for providing optical clarity for the passage of light, mechanical strength, such as for example, resistance to external pressure, and heat dissipation. One or more screws, such as a set of six circumferentially spaced machine screws <b>118</b>, may be used secure the window retaining flange <b>114</b> to the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. The aft pressure housing <b>120</b> may include a cylindrical neck <b>202</b> (as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>), and may be surrounded by a mount <b>126</b>, which may be used for attaching the light fixture <b>100</b> to an underwater structure (not shown). An electrical connector, such as a five-pin underwater electrical connector <b>130</b> may be fitted into the neck of the aft pressure housing <b>120</b>. For example, electrical connector <b>130</b> may include a male threaded segment that screws into a female threaded bore or aperture that extends through the cylindrical neck <b>202</b>. Female threads may be disposed on the surface of the connector <b>130</b> and/or on a connector locking sleeve <b>134</b> (optional) for preventing accidental de-mating of the underwater connector <b>130</b> from a power cable (not shown) during normal operations. The connector <b>130</b> may also include one or more conductive contact pins <b>132</b> for providing power to the circuit boards inside the light fixture <b>100</b>. A label, such a tamper-evident label <b>142</b>, or a cover may be disposed over the seam where the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b> mate to indicate and/or deter tampering, to provide an additional permeation barrier, and/or to provide an additional mechanical coupling for the forward and aft housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. The cover may include a threaded coupler (not shown) with female threads that couple to male threads on the exterior wall of the housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> (not shown). An alternative cover may attach to one or more of the housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> using fasteners, adhesive, tongue-and-groove, a clamping mechanism, or other feature.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Referring again to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more drive pin holes, such as a set of two drive pin holes <b>116</b> may be used during assembly for engaging the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. The two drive pin holes <b>116</b> may pass through the window retaining flange <b>114</b> and partially into the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. The mount <b>126</b> may typically be made of one or more materials, such as a glass-filled plastic. The forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b> may comprise one or more suitable metals, such as anodized aluminum alloy, beryllium copper, stainless steel, titanium, and the like.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are section views illustrating additional details of the underwater, generally spherical LED light fixture <b>100</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b> may be joined by a coupling element, such as an interior threaded center coupling element <b>220</b> to form a generally spherical housing. One of skill in the art will appreciate alternatives to the threaded center coupling element <b>220</b>, including an exterior threaded coupling element (e.g., a coupling element with female threads that couples to male threads formed on the exterior walls of the housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>). One of skill in the art will also appreciate that no center coupling element is needed where male threads are formed on one of the housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and female threads are formed on the other housings <b>110</b> or <b>120</b> for coupling the two housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. One of skill in the art will further appreciate non-threaded coupling elements, including clamps, adhesive materials, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">The threaded coupling element <b>220</b> may be designed using the same or similar materials as the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b>. The material of the coupling element <b>220</b> may be selected to provide direct heat transfer from the interior of the spherical housing, to the forward and aft pressure housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, and then to the external environment (e.g., the ocean). In one aspect, the threaded coupling element may be used to suspend one or more PCBs at the equator of the generally spherical housing. For example, a first LED driver PCB <b>222</b> may be mounted to the top face of threaded center coupling element <b>220</b>, and the second LED driver PCB <b>224</b> may be mounted to the bottom face of threaded center coupling element <b>220</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Various elements and sub-assemblies may be configured with the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and aft pressure housing <b>120</b>, to provide a pressure-resistant and leak-resistant housing having an interior volume that remains dry and at surface air pressure (or some other desired and/or controllable pressure). For example, a sealing element, such as a housing O-ring <b>228</b>, may be disposed between forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and aft pressure housing <b>120</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, housing O-ring <b>228</b> may be seated into the annular groove (not shown) disposed on the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, and compressed in assembly between forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and aft pressure housing <b>120</b> to provide a seal at the interface or seam. A sealing element, such as connector O-ring <b>212</b>, may be disposed between the connector <b>130</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b>. A sealing element, such as window O-ring <b>232</b> may be disposed between the window <b>112</b> and a surface of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, and secured by window retaining flange <b>114</b>. For example, in assembly, the window retaining flange <b>114</b> and screws <b>118</b> may be configured with the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, such that window O-ring <b>232</b> is clamped between window <b>112</b> and a surface of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, to provide the water-tight seal. In some embodiments, the O-rings may assist in the transfer of thermal heat.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">The mount <b>126</b> clamps to the exterior of the cylindrical neck <b>202</b> of aft pressure housing <b>120</b>. In an alternate embodiment (not shown), the mount <b>126</b> may be configured to alternatively or to also grip an exterior section of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. In yet another embodiment (not shown), the mount <b>126</b> may be configured to alternatively or to also grip exterior sections of the forward and aft pressure housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> where those housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> mate. Such an embodiment would provide additional mechanical strength for coupling the housings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, and would provide more exterior surface area in contact with the external environment (e.g., the ocean) for transferring thermal energy to that external environment from the interior of the generally spherical housing. Electrical power may be provided to the light fixture through one or more contact pins <b>132</b> of the underwater connector <b>130</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">Referring again to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the set of two drive pin holes <b>116</b> may extend through the window retaining flange <b>114</b> and partially into the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> to provide an aperture for engaging and turning the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. One of skill in the art will appreciate that other mechanical features of the present invention may be used to turn the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates additional details of an equatorial region <b>400</b> (e.g., region <b>4</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) of the underwater LED light fixture <b>100</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b> may be joined by the threaded center coupling element <b>220</b>, and sealed by the housing O-ring <b>228</b>. Male threads <b>406</b> formed on the threaded center coupling element <b>220</b> may engage female threads <b>404</b> on the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and female threads <b>408</b> of the aft pressure housing <b>120</b>, for providing varying degrees of mechanical strength depending on the density and surface area coverage of the threads <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> and <b>408</b>. The threads <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> also direct thermal transfer from the threaded center coupling element <b>220</b> to the external environment (e.g., the ocean). The tamper-evident label or impermeable cover <b>142</b> is attached (e.g., via adhesion, mechanical fastening, or other means), and covers the seam between the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> and the aft pressure housing <b>120</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">First PCB <b>222</b> and second PCB <b>224</b> may be joined together with one or more screws <b>412</b>, and mounted into a PCB carrier that may be disposed along the equator of the spherical housing.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates additional details of an LED light fixture sub-assembly <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, a sealing element, such as window O-ring <b>232</b> may be disposed between the window <b>112</b> and an outer circular section <b>502</b> of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, and secured by window retaining flange <b>114</b>. For example, in assembly, the window retaining flange <b>114</b> and screws <b>118</b> may be configured with the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, such that window O-ring <b>232</b> is clamped between window <b>112</b> and outer circular section <b>502</b> to provide a water-tight seal. One or more high brightness LEDs <b>512</b> may be disposed on the outward facing side of an LED PCB, such as LED PCB <b>510</b>, which may be seated in a stepped aperture or bore <b>516</b> formed into the front side of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">A circular reflector body <b>522</b> may be disposed between the window <b>112</b> and the LED PCB <b>510</b> for redirecting light through window <b>112</b>. Circular reflector plate <b>522</b> may be made of molded plastic, or other similar or equivalent materials. This stack of components, which may include LED PCB <b>510</b>, LEDs <b>512</b>, and circular reflector body <b>522</b>, may be restrained by a circular metallic spring <b>532</b> that presses against the inside face of the window <b>112</b>, transfers thermal energy to the window <b>112</b> and the forward housing <b>110</b>, and clamps the LED PCB <b>510</b> to the forward housing <b>110</b> for heat transfer.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">The LED PCB <b>510</b> may be supported by an inner circular section <b>504</b> of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. A layer of phase change material (PCM) <b>526</b>, such as Tmate&#x2122; 2900 Series, or other similar or equivalent materials, may be used for providing enhanced thermal coupling to the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. An air gap <b>528</b> disposed between the LED PCB <b>510</b> and the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> may provide electrical insulation. The air gap <b>528</b> may be configured to provide only an annular air gap around the outer diameter of the LED PCB <b>510</b>. Electrical power for the LEDs <b>512</b> may be provided by one or more spring contacts <b>534</b>. The stepped configuration of the bore <b>516</b> forms a cavity into which the LED PCB and LEDs are inserted, and allows for the aperture through the front side of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b> to be minimal in size since only the spring contacts <b>534</b> need to pass there through. By minimizing the size of the aperture, a desired level of strength of the generally spherical housing formed by the joined body halves <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> is achieved.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">In alternative embodiments (not shown), the LED PCB may be positioned inside the interior of the housing, where no bore is needed and the aperture is sized with a diameter large enough to allow light from the LEDs to pass through the aperture and the window. In such embodiments, an annular portion of the window may be designed to fit around a corresponding annular portion of the exterior wall of the forward housing (e.g., the portion of the window may match the curvature or flatness of the portion of the forward housing's exterior wall). Annular grooves may be cut into the exterior surface of the forward housing to receive an O-ring for creating a watertight seal between the window and the forward housing.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">In one aspect, the central plane of the LED PCB <b>510</b> may be positioned and supported in an approximate tangential relationship to the outer diameter (OD) of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>. This placement may vary between one and two wall thicknesses (i.e., between two wall surfaces) of the forward pressure housing <b>110</b>, such that the addition of the window <b>112</b> does not affect the inherent pressure resistance of the spherical housing body.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment underwater LED light fixture <b>600</b>, which may correspond with various aspects of embodiment 600 as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, LED light fixture <b>600</b> is shown to include a forward pressure housing <b>610</b>, and a window <b>612</b> that may be larger in diameter than window <b>112</b>. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates a crash guard <b>614</b> which may be retained by a plurality of fasteners <b>618</b> (e.g., plastic set screws). In accordance with one aspect of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, crash guard <b>614</b> may include one or more vent holes <b>616</b> configured to provide flow through of ambient fluid (e.g., seawater) for enhanced cooling.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">An aft pressure housing <b>620</b>, which may correspond with details of aft pressure housing <b>120</b>, may be mated to forward pressure housing <b>610</b> in a similar fashion to that set forth in the preceding text. A mount bracket <b>626</b>, which may correspond to mount <b>126</b>, may be clamped around a portion of the aft housing <b>620</b>, the forward housing <b>610</b> or both. The LED light fixture <b>600</b> may receive electrical power from various components, such as a power cable (not shown), and an electrical connector <b>630</b> (e.g., a five-pin underwater electrical connector), which may correspond to electrical connector <b>130</b>. For example, underwater electrical connector <b>630</b> may include one or more conductive contact pins <b>632</b> and a cylindrical sleeve <b>634</b>, which may correspond with conductive contact pins <b>132</b> and cylindrical sleeve <b>134</b>. A tamper-evident label or other cover <b>642</b>, may be used to indicate and/or deter tampering, or to further couple the forward and aft housings <b>610</b> and <b>620</b>.</p>\n",

A window O-ring <b>732</b>, which may correspond to <b>232</b>, may be disposed between the window <b>612</b> and a surface of the forward pressure housing <b>610</b> to provide a water-tight seal. The underwater electrical connector <b>630</b> may be sealed to the aft pressure housing <b>620</b> by a connector O-ring <b>712</b>, which may correspond to electrical connector O-ring <b>212</b>.

The sensor data can be LiDAR data which is expressed as multiple image representations. Image representations that include important LiDAR data undergo a lossless compression while image representations that include LiDAR data that is more error-tolerant undergo a lossy compression. Therefore, the compressed sensor data can be transmitted to an online system for building a high definition map. When building a high definition map, entities, such as road signs and road lines, are constructed such that when encoded and compressed, the high definition map consumes less storage space. The positions of entities are expressed in relation to a reference centerline in the high definition map.

       "  'abstract': 'A radar antenna system includes a single transmitter for creating pulses from a wideband waveform. A splitter divides each pulse into half-power pulses, and sends them along respective paths. On one path, successive half-power pulses are alternately modulated with a phase shift &#x3d5;A or &#x3d5;F. On the other path, the half-power pulses are not modulated. Each modulated half-power pulse is then combined with an un-modulated half-power pulse to transmit pulses of a full aperture beam with either &#x3d5;A or &#x3d5;F. This establishes two degrees of freedom for the system. Two separate receivers then simultaneously receive the pulse echoes and a signal processor uses the consequent four degrees of freedom to create a radar indicator with mitigated clutter and useable azimuth estimation.

Thus, in accordance with a first aspect it is exactly the increase of the freedom which alleviates the signaling overhead provided that co-located texture information in form of a picture is present. Another aspect pertains the possibility to save side information rate involved with signaling a respective coding mode supporting irregular partitioning.'},\n",
